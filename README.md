# dayPlanner

A day planner is an essential tool to help you stay on top of things and to be productive. This particular day planner shows the user hours 9am-5pm in block form, so it gives you room to write down events or any notes for a particular hour. On the top of the page the current time and day is shown. Based on the current time, the schedule blocks will change color. Red being the current hour, green for the hours left in the day, and hours that have past are shown in grey.

This is the following criteria for the project:

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
